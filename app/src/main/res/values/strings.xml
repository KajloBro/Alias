    <string name="info">Number of players: 4+\n\nAlias is a word
        game that you play in turns.\n\nIn Alias you have to say
        a term in other words, using synonyms, opposites or clues
        so that your team mate guess as many words as possible.\n\nBefore
        the beginning you can customize length of the turn,
        goal result and corpus.\n\nYou collect 1 point each time your team
        mate answers a term correctly and lose 1 point when you
        decide to give up and move on the next term.\n\nPlayers must
        not use any part of the term, a derivate of it nor
        gestures(if you do so you might be forced by opponents to press
        Wrong Button).\n\nThe team who reaches a goal result first is
        the winner.\n\nTips: Keep both hands on the phone to avoid gestures.
        \n\nWhen there is less than 10 seconds left, consider about pressing
        wrong button because there might not be enough time to guess the
        next word</string>
